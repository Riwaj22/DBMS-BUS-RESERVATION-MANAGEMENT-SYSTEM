# DBMS-BUS-RESERVATION-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Bus Reservation Management System’ is an application which helps to maintain the
day-to-day records and information for the bus transportation organizations. It should
be used in a bus transportation system, a facility which is used to reserve seats,
cancellation of reservation and different types of route enquiries used on securing
quick reservations. So, our project ‘Bus Reservation Management System’ is made to
make the people’s life easier by providing the information about the availability of the
vehicles and keeping track of such details and easy records for the data. It helps the
vehicle organization to keep perform their task more efficiently in an errorless
manner. Also, keeping the records offline risks the loss or theft of data. So, the
application can be used to keep the records of all such data in database to be secured
from all such possibilities.
